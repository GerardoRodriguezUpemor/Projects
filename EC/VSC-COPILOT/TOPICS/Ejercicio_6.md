## Grammar: Describing Past Repeated or Habitual Actions with "used to"

This exercise focuses on rewriting sentences using the structure "used to" to describe actions that happened regularly in the past but no longer happen. Here is the grammar logic and analysis:

### 1. Structure
**used to + base verb**
- "Used to" is followed by the base form of the main verb (e.g., used to collect, used to sew).
- The subject comes before "used to."

### 2. Usage
- Used to talk about past habits, repeated actions, or situations that are no longer true.
- It is not used for present habits or actions.

### 3. Examples from the Exercise
1. **Mom used to collect** old clothes so she could use the cloth. (Past habit)
2. **She used to sew** pieces together in beautiful patterns. (Past repeated action)
3. **All our relatives used to ask** her to make them quilts. (Past repeated request)
4. **I used to help** her sometimes, and I learned to make quilts, too. (Past habit)

### 4. Analysis
- The structure is simple and does not change for different subjects (I/you/he/she/we/they used to ...).
- It is only used for the past; for present habits, use the simple present (e.g., "I help her sometimes").
- "Used to" can be used in statements, questions (Did you use to...?), and negatives (didn't use to ...).

**Summary:**
The grammar logic is to use "used to" with the base verb to describe actions or situations that were true in the past but are not true now. This helps you talk about your past routines, habits, and experiences in English.
