## Grammar: Describing Past Repeated or Habitual Actions 2 â€“ Using "would" and "used to"

This exercise focuses on completing sentences with either "would" or "used to" to describe actions that happened regularly in the past. Here is the grammar logic and analysis:

### 1. Structure
- **would + base verb**: Used to describe repeated actions or habits in the past (not for states).
- **used to + base verb**: Used to describe past habits, repeated actions, or states that are no longer true.

### 2. Usage
- Use "would" for actions that were repeated or habitual in the past (e.g., My mother would play the piano).
- Use "used to" for both actions and states in the past (e.g., I used to be shy).
- "Would" is not used for past states (e.g., be, like, want, know, etc.). For these, use "used to."

### 3. Examples from the Exercise
1. **My mother would play** the piano and sing. (Repeated action)
2. **Everybody used to love** her singing. (Past state/feeling)
3. **My father would take out** his violin and join her. (Repeated action)
4. **He used to like** to sing harmony. (Past state)
5. **My brothers would join in** on their guitars. (Repeated action)
6. **I used to be** a little shy about playing my cello. (Past state)
7. **I would sing** with my parents. (Repeated action)
8. **Our neighbors used to want** to hear us. (Past state)

### 4. Analysis
- "Would" is only used for repeated actions, not for states or situations.
- "Used to" can be used for both repeated actions and states.
- Both forms help describe what was typical or regular in the past but is not true now.

**Summary:**
The grammar logic is to use "would" for repeated past actions and "used to" for both repeated actions and past states. This helps you talk about your past routines, habits, and feelings in English with more variety and accuracy.
