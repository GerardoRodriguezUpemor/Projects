## Grammar: Expressing an Expectation with "be supposed to" (Part 2)

This exercise focuses on rewriting sentences using the structure "be supposed to" to express expectations, obligations, prohibitions, or arrangements. Here is the grammar logic and analysis:

### 1. Structure
**be (am/are/is/was/were) + supposed to + base verb**
- The verb "be" changes according to the subject and tense (present or past).
- "Supposed to" is followed by the base form of the main verb.

### 2. Usage
- Used to talk about what is expected, required, or intended to happen.
- Can be used in questions, negatives, and statements.
- Negative form: "not supposed to" expresses prohibition or something that should not happen.

### 3. Examples from the Exercise
1. **We are supposed to complete our report by Friday.** (Expectation: required to finish by Friday)
2. **Taxi drivers are supposed to help passengers with their suitcases.** (Expectation: required to help)
3. **You are not supposed to take this medicine on an empty stomach.** (Prohibition: not allowed to do)
4. **We are not supposed to say anything about the plan yet.** (Prohibition: not allowed to talk)
5. **David was supposed to wait for the rest of us.** (Past expectation: he should have waited)
6. **Who was supposed to order the supplies?** (Question: who was expected to do it?)
7. **Am I supposed to return the call?** (Question: is it my responsibility?)
8. **When are the kids supposed to do their homework?** (Question: when is it expected?)

### 4. Capitalization
- Answers must use correct capitalization (first word and proper nouns capitalized).

### 5. Analysis
- The structure is flexible and can be used for present or past expectations, as well as for prohibitions.
- It is often used to talk about rules, plans, or things that are expected but may not always happen.
- The negative form is important for expressing what is not allowed or not expected.

**Summary:**
The grammar logic is to use the correct form of "be" with "supposed to" and the base verb to express what is expected, required, intended, or prohibited in different contexts (statements, questions, negatives, present, and past). This helps communicate rules, expectations, and responsibilities clearly in English.
