## Grammar: Expressing an Expectation with "be supposed to"

This exercise practices the use of the structure "be supposed to" to express expectations, obligations, or arrangements. Here is the grammar logic and analysis:

### 1. Structure
**be (am/are/is/was/were) + supposed to + base verb**
- The verb "be" changes according to the subject and tense (present or past).
- "Supposed to" is followed by the base form of the main verb.

### 2. Usage
- Used to talk about what is expected, required, or intended to happen.
- Can be used in questions, negatives, and statements.

### 3. Examples from the Exercise
1. **You are supposed to call** him back. (Expectation: you should call)
2. **Mona is supposed to be** here in a half hour. (Expectation: Mona should arrive)
3. **The package was supposed to arrive** yesterday. (Past expectation: it should have arrived)
4. **Am I supposed to do** it? (Question: Is it my responsibility?)
5. **Are people supposed to park** here? (Question: Is this the expected place to park?)
6. **He is not supposed to know** about the party. (Negative: He should not know)
7. **Employees were supposed to attend** the meeting. (Past expectation: they should have attended)
8. **Who is supposed to provide** the training? (Question: Who is expected to do it?)

### 4. Capitalization
- Answers must use correct capitalization (first word and proper nouns capitalized).

### 5. Analysis
- The structure is flexible and can be used for present or past expectations.
- It is often used to talk about rules, plans, or things that are expected but may not always happen.
- Negative form: "not supposed to" expresses prohibition or something that should not happen.

**Summary:**
The grammar logic is to use the correct form of "be" with "supposed to" and the base verb to express what is expected, required, or intended in different contexts (statements, questions, negatives, present, and past).
