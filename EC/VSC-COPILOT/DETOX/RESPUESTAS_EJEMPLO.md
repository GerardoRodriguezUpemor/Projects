# Detox Presentation â€“ Sample Answers (B1 Level)

## 1. What could you do in your daily life that might contribute to stop an overuse of technology at school?

At school, I think technology is essential because it helps us understand any subject or hobby. But to avoid overusing it, I can set limits for myself. For example, I can use my phone or computer only for studying and not for social media during class. I can also try to do some activities without technology, like reading a book or talking face-to-face with my classmates. This way, I use technology in a smart way and not too much.

## 2. What personal actions are you taking, or could you take to use technology better?

Right now, I am learning a lot about how to use AI to improve my learning. I try not to depend on it, but I use it to create a study model that works for me. For example, when I have a question, I ask the AI, and then I do an activity with its help. After that, I try to do another activity alone to see if I really learned. This helps me use technology as a tool, not as something I need all the time.
