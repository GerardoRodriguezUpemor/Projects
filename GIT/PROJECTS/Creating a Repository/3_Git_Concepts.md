# Git Concepts: Merging, Pushing, and Branching

This document provides a conceptual overview of key Git operations.

## Pushing

*   **`git push`** uploads your local commits to a remote repository. This is how you share your work with others and back it up to a central server like GitHub.

## Branching

*   **Branches** are independent lines of development. You can create a new branch to work on a new feature without affecting the main codebase.
*   The `main` branch is typically the primary branch of the repository.

## Merging

*   **`git merge`** combines the changes from different branches. For example, you would merge your feature branch into the `main` branch once the feature is complete.
*   **Merge conflicts** can occur if the same lines of code have been changed in both branches. These must be resolved manually.
