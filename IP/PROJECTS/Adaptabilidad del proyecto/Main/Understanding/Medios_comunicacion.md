Media for scientific communication: which are the most effective?
We give you the keys to decide which scenarios, actions, channels and media can bring us closer to our target audiences and a better assessment of our research activity.

When we plan our communications professionally, the first thing we do is define who we want to address, what objectives we pursue, and what message we're trying to convey. Once this strategy is designed, it's time to move on to tactics: that is, to think about the situations and actions in which our ideas will best reach our audiences; and through which channels and media we can directly reach the recipients of our messages. The tips for making an efficient selection... are in the following lines.


Where can I find information on scenarios, actions, channels, and media?

In Spain, the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) offers the most direct information on where we can find our audience, specifically through its "Survey on the Social Perception of Science and Technology in Spain," conducted every two years. This publication includes a section on the media used by citizens to obtain information on science and technology: the most recent results are from 2018.

FECYT itself, through its collaboration with the CRUE R&D&I Scientific Culture and Outreach Working Group (Red Divulga), has recently published another highly useful tool, mainly because it presents a full range of potential scientific communication actions and assesses them based on the weight they would have as merit in an evaluation process of our research activity: the “Guide to the evaluation of scientific outreach activities by academic and research staff”.

They are two extraordinary sources for guiding our tactical work in planning scientific communication in the different areas in which we carry out our work, whether from an institution, for a project, or as research staff subject to constant evaluation processes.

Scenarios and media for scientific communication
There are many options available to us for developing an effective science communication strategy. So, to get off to a good start, it might be helpful to narrow down the types of settings in which our actions can be implemented. Based on the response options offered by the "Survey on the Social Perception of Science and Technology in Spain" to the question about what media people use to learn about science, we propose the following social communication scenarios:
With this generic information, we can confirm a gap between media or publications (mass-scale) and social media (much smaller but highly segmented and more predisposed). But it's when we turn to filtered data that we can extract some insights to make decisions more tailored to the profiles of our target audiences. We highlight the following results:

Scientific communication actions
As we pointed out in a  , to complete the tactical phase that follows the identification of the target audience map and the strategic design of ideas and messages, we have to decide what actions we will deploy in the most appropriate scenarios of those presented in the previous lines, and through which media and channels we will develop them. The possibilities are very adequately organized by the  , which classifies them and guides us on their potential value in research activity evaluation processes:

As we see in the weight estimates in the previous list, there is a certain relationship with the audience volume we can find in the corresponding scenarios, but it is enriched and nuanced by taking into account the quality (understood as adequacy to the characteristics, demands, and interests) of the target audiences, who are at the same time—we must never forget this—our starting point and our destination. And once the range of options is known, it's time to evaluate them by exposing them to three filters: our competition, the available resources, and the realistic performance we can achieve.

If competitive projects are our strength , a good option would be to participate in a project funded by the FECYT (Federal Technical Commission for Catalonia), or to participate in competitions or calls for institutional awards . These are initiatives already geared toward specific segments of the population and with which we can align our objectives.

If our target audience is open to science talk in school, academic, work, or personal settings, then the most effective way to do this is to teach or organize courses, conferences, or roundtable discussions ; generate experiences through in-person interactive activities (in laboratories, scientific facilities, on visits, on field trips, etc.); hold school competitions ; or participate in educational events such as  , science monologues like  , or science initiatives in bars or cafés like  .

If we have sufficient resources and capacity, we can consider publishing books with prestigious publishers or those with good distribution in specialty stores and bookstores; writing informative articles in the national press; or organizing attractive exhibitions . Or collaborate by disseminating scientific content.

on television programs like  ; on the radio or in podcasts like  ; or on a group blog or research project like Ciberimaginario and Comciencia; or through a Twitter account , a  , an  , or any of the many other options offered by social media.
